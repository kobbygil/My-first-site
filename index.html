            <p>I'm obsessed with making things and even more obsessed with making things better. I've been in the business of creating since I hung my first painting on the fridge when I was 3. After graduating from the University of Kentucky, I've been actively involved in the web design community for the last 10 years. I've designed websites for small businesses, corporations, nonprofits, churches, musicians and more. I also started a design blog, <a href="#">Visual Swirl</a>, where I share inspiration, tutorials, and resources. <br>
            </p>
            <p>My specialty is full website strategy, design and development, making pixel magic in photoshop and turning it into beautiful, semantic HTML & CSS. My interests, however, extend beyond the web and I love helping people with branding, print design and marketing strategy. I even love making designs move by creating professional <a href="#">motion graphics and video.</a> <br>
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not designing, I'm probably hanging out with my wife, being entertained by our amazing 5 year old little girl, watching college basketball, playing golf or messing around on something inspired by Steve Jobs. <br>
